						GroTech @ Berkeley is dedicated to providing students with hands-on
						learning opportunities at the intersection of botany and technology.
						Every semester, we identify agricultural challenges and assemble
						interdisciplinary project teams to tackle those problems. In these
						project teams, students research, design, and build innovative plant
						growth technologies, enriching their educational journey while
						meaningfully contributing to society.

						NASA'S GROWING BEYOND EARTH CHALLENGE WINNERS
					</h1>
					<p class="news-body">
						Our team won Phase One of The Growing Beyond Earth Maker Challenge.
						This competition challenges makers from high school, college, and
						professional levels to design, prototype, and eventually build and
						test plant growth chambers optimized for micro-gravity environments.
						Each submission is standardized to growing red romaine lettuce; must
						fit within a 50 cm cube; take into consideration lighting,
						irrigation, and airflow; and improve upon some aspect of NASA's
						current plant growth chamber, Veggie.

									ENERGY-EFFICIENT HYDROPONICS SYSTEM
								</h2>
								<p class="project-descriptor">
									Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water. This
									method is water-conservative and high yield, yet it is
									incredibly inefficient, energy-wise as it consumes incredible
									amounts of power for LED lights and water/air pumps. Our
									objective is to design a novel system that reduces
									energy-waste and draws power from renewable solar energy.

								<h2 class="project-name">AUTOMATED PLANT PEST COUNTER APP</h2>
								<p class="project-descriptor">
									Greenhouse laboratories, such as UC Berkeley's Oxford
									Greenhouse, employ yellow sticky traps to monitor and control
									plant pests. These traps capture hundreds of insects which are
									laborious to classify and count with the human eye. Our
									objective is to design an automated plant pest counter mobile
									app. The user takes a picture of the trap and an algorithm
									automatically classifies and counts the various pests present.

								<h2 class="project-name">PLANT SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT</h2>
								<p class="project-descriptor">
									Space and time in our urbanized society have become
									increasingly scarce, making it difficult to grow fresh food in
									our communities. By exploring spatial arrangement of plants in
									conjunction with robotics, we can develop new systems that are
									space-efficient and low-maintenance.â€‹

								<h2 class="project-name">GROWING BEYOND EARTH PHASE TWO</h2>
								<p class="project-descriptor">
									Growing Beyond Earth Phase 2 is the continuation from the
									first phase of the competition, in which our team had won. We
									are focusing on growing and maximizing edible lettuce biomass
									in SeedShuttle, our beloved plant growth chamber. We are also
									working to make our chamber more environmentally friendly
									through sustainable plant pots with our sustainability
									committee.
