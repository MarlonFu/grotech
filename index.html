						Every semester, we identify agricultural challenges and assemble
						interdisciplinary project teams to tackle those problems. In these
						project teams, students research, design, and build innovative plant
						growth technologies, enriching their educational journey while

						NASA'S GROWING BEYOND EARTH CHALLENGE WINNERS
					</h1>
					<p class="news-body">
						Our team won Year 1 of the Growing Beyond Earth Maker Contest. This
						competition challenges makers to design, prototype, and eventually
						build and test plant growth chambers optimized for micro-gravity
						environments. Each submission is standardized to growing red romaine
						lettuce; must fit within a 50 cm cube; take into consideration
						lighting, irrigation, and airflow; and improve upon some aspect of
						NASA's current plant growth chamber, Veggie.

									ENERGY-EFFICIENT HYDROPONICS SYSTEM
								</h2>
								<p class="project-descriptor">
									Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water. This
									method is water-conservative and high yield, yet it is
									incredibly inefficient, energy-wise as it consumes incredible
									amounts of power for LED lights and water/air pumps. Our
									objective is to design a novel system that reduces
									energy-waste and draws power from renewable solar energy.

								<h2 class="project-name">Growing Beyond Earth Year 2</h2>
								<p class="project-descriptor">
									Growing plants aboard spacecraft consumes valuable space and
									requires regular maintenance. The Growing Beyond Earth project
									team is developing a microgravity-compatible plant growth
									chamber that maximizes production in a constrained volume. For
									the design portion of our project, we have so far achieved a
									four-fold increase in space utilization compared to The
									Vegetable Production System (Veggie) aboard the ISS. Our goal
									for Year 2 is to maintain or efficientize this space
									utilization and automate our systemâ€™s lighting, air
									circulation, and watering.

								<h2 class="project-name">PLANT PEST CONTROL APP</h2>
								<p class="project-descriptor">
									Greenhouse laboratories, such as UC Berkeley's Oxford
									Greenhouse, employ yellow sticky traps to monitor and control
									plant pests. These traps capture hundreds of insects which
									are laborious to classify and count with the human eye. Our
									objective is to design an automated plant pest counter web
									app. The user takes a picture of the trap and an algorithm
									automatically classifies and counts the various pests present.
