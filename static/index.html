            GroTech @ Berkeley is dedicated to providing students with hands-on 
            learning opportunities at the intersection of botany and technology. 
            Every semester, we identify agricultural challenges and assemble 
            interdisciplinary project teams to tackle those problems. In these 
            project teams, students research, design, and build innovative plant 
            growth technologies, enriching their educational journey while meaningfully 
            contributing to society.

        <p class="news-body">Our team won Phase One of The Growing Beyond Earth Maker 
            Challenge. This competition challenges makers from high school, college, and professional levels to 
            design, prototype, and eventually build and test plant growth chambers 
            optimized for micro-gravity environments. Each submission is standardized to growing red romaine lettuce; 
            must fit within a 50 cm cube; take into consideration lighting, irrigation, 
            and airflow; and improve upon some aspect of NASA's current plant growth 
            chamber, Veggie.

                    <p class="project-descriptor">
                        Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water. This method is water-conservative and high yield, 
                        yet it is incredibly inefficient, energy-wise as it consumes incredible amounts of power for LED lights 
                        and water/air pumps. Our objective is to design a novel system that reduces energy-waste and draws power 
                        from renewable solar energy.

                    <p class="project-descriptor">
                        Greenhouse laboratories, such as UC Berkeley's Oxford Greenhouse, employ yellow sticky traps to monitor 
                        and control plant pests. These traps capture hundreds of insects which are laborious to classify and count 
                        with the human eye. Our objective is to design an automated plant pest counter mobile app. The user takes a 
                        picture of the trap and an algorithm automatically classifies and counts the various pests present.

                    <p class="project-descriptor">
                        Space and time in our urbanized society have become increasingly scarce, making it difficult to grow fresh 
                        food in our communities. By exploring spatial arrangement of plants in conjunction with robotics, we can 
                        develop new systems that are space-efficient and low-maintenance.â€‹

                        Growing Beyond Earth Phase 2 is the continuation from the first phase of the competition, in which our team 
                        had won. We are focusing on growing and maximizing edible lettuce biomass in SeedShuttle, our beloved plant growth 
                        chamber. We are also working to make our chamber more environmentally friendly through sustainable plant pots with 
                        our sustainability committee.
